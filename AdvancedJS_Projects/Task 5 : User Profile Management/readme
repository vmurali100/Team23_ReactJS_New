# User Profile Management

## Overview
The User Profile Management system is a dynamic web application designed to manage user profiles with roles like **Admin** and **Subscriber**. It incorporates advanced JavaScript features such as symbols for securely storing unique user metadata and regular expressions for validating input fields. The application allows for adding, updating, and deleting user profiles while dynamically synchronizing changes with a server.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Dynamic User Profiles**:
  - Fetch user profiles from an external API.
  - Add, update, and delete user profiles dynamically.
- **Role Management**:
  - Assign roles like Admin or Subscriber to users.
- **Metadata Security**:
  - Use symbols to securely store unique metadata for each user.
- **Input Validation**:
  - Validate usernames and emails using regular expressions.

### Advanced Features
- **Asynchronous Programming**:
  - Fetch and synchronize user data with the server using `fetch()` and `async/await`.
- **Dynamic Rendering**:
  - Render user profiles dynamically using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Gracefully handle input errors with clear alerts.

## Key Concepts

1. **Symbols**:
   - Securely store unique user metadata such as creation time.

2. **Regular Expressions**:
   - Validate usernames (3-20 characters, alphanumeric with underscores).
   - Validate email addresses (standard email format).

3. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Use `fetch()` and `async/await` to retrieve user profiles dynamically.

4. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Automatically update the UI as users are added, updated, or deleted.
