# Digital Address Book

## Overview
The Digital Address Book is a dynamic web application designed to store and organize contact information. It leverages advanced JavaScript concepts such as **web workers** for processing bulk updates and **regular expressions** for search functionality. Users can manage their contacts dynamically by adding, editing, and deleting entries, as well as performing bulk updates efficiently.
