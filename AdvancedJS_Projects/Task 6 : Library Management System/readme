# Library Management System

## Overview
The Library Management System is a dynamic web application designed to track book availability and manage lending operations. It incorporates advanced JavaScript concepts such as **Proxy** for tracking and validating book status, and **closures** for managing lending durations. The system allows for fetching, adding, and updating books dynamically while synchronizing changes with a server.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Dynamic Inventory Management**:
  - Fetch book inventory from an external API.
  - Add new books to the library.
  - Update book availability dynamically.
- **Lending and Returning Books**:
  - Track lending status and durations for each book.
  - Use closures to encapsulate lending duration logic.
- **Validation with Proxy**:
  - Validate and securely manage book status changes.

### Advanced Features
- **Asynchronous Programming**:
  - Fetch and update book inventory with `fetch()` and `async/await`.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handle API and operational errors gracefully using `try...catch`.
- **Dynamic Rendering**:
  - Render book inventory dynamically using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the application interface.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality.
  - **Proxy**: Securely manage book status validations.
  - **Closures**: Track and encapsulate lending durations.
  - **Fetch API**: Retrieve library inventory dynamically.
  - **Error Handling**: Ensure smooth operation with `try...catch`.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern UI design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Fetch Library Inventory**:
   - Upon loading, the application fetches the library's book inventory from an external API.

2. **Add a Book**:
   - Enter the book title and author in the input fields.
   - Click the "Add Book" button to add the book to the library.

3. **Lend a Book**:
   - Click the "Lend" button to mark a book as "Lent Out."

4. **Return a Book**:
   - Click the "Return" button to mark a book as "Available."
   - An alert will display the lending duration.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Invalid operations (e.g., lending a book that is already lent out) are prevented with alerts.

## Key Concepts

1. **Proxy**:
   - Intercepts and validates changes to book status (Available or Lent Out).

2. **Closures**:
   - Encapsulates logic for tracking lending durations.

3. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Fetch book inventory and handle operations dynamically with `fetch()` and `async/await`.

4. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Automatically updates the UI as books are added, lent, or returned.

## Future Enhancements

- **Search Functionality**:
  - Allow users to search for books by title or author.
- **Pagination**:
  - Add pagination for managing large inventories.
- **User Roles**:
  - Implement roles for librarians and borrowers.
- **Notifications**:
  - Send alerts or reminders for overdue books.
