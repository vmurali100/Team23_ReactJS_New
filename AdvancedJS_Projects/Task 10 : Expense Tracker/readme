# Expense Tracker

## Overview
The Expense Tracker is a dynamic web application that allows users to manage their daily expenses efficiently. It provides features for adding, categorizing, and deleting expenses while dynamically calculating totals. The system leverages modern JavaScript features like **Proxy** for validation, **localStorage** for persistence, and **asynchronous programming** for fetching and synchronizing data.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Dynamic Expense Management**:
  - Add new expenses under specific categories.
  - Delete existing expenses.
  - Categorize expenses for better organization.
- **Expense Validation**:
  - Validate expense amounts and descriptions using Proxy.

### Advanced Features
- **Persistent Storage**:
  - Save and load expense data using localStorage for offline access.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**:
  - Fetch initial expense data from a remote server using `fetch()` and `async/await`.
- **Dynamic Rendering**:
  - Display all expenses dynamically and update totals in real-time.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Gracefully handle errors, such as invalid inputs or API failures, using `try...catch`.

## Key Concepts

1. **Proxy**:
   - Validates expense data, ensuring only valid amounts and descriptions are allowed.

2. **localStorage**:
   - Provides persistent storage for expenses, enabling offline access.

3. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Fetch and synchronize expense data dynamically using `fetch()` and `async/await`.

4. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Updates the UI in real-time as expenses are added or deleted.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensures the system remains stable even when encountering invalid inputs or API issues.

## Future Enhancements

- **Sorting and Filtering**:
  - Add sorting by date, category, or amount.
  - Implement advanced filters for specific categories or date ranges.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Include graphs and charts for expense trends.
- **User Authentication**:
  - Allow users to log in and save expenses to individual accounts.
- **Export Data**:
  - Provide an option to export expenses as a CSV or Excel file.
