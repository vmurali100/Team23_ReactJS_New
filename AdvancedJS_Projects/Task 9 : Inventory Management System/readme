# Inventory Management System

## Overview
The Inventory Management System is a dynamic web application designed to manage product inventory for warehouses or shops. It leverages modern JavaScript features such as **Proxy** for stock validation, **IndexedDB** for offline storage, and **asynchronous programming** for fetching and updating data dynamically. The system allows users to add, update, and remove products while synchronizing changes with the server.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Dynamic Inventory Management**:
  - Add new products to the inventory.
  - Update product quantities dynamically.
  - Remove products from the inventory.
- **Stock Validation with Proxy**:
  - Prevent invalid stock operations, such as setting negative quantities.
- **Offline Storage with IndexedDB**:
  - Store inventory data locally for offline access.

### Advanced Features
- **Asynchronous Programming**:
  - Fetch inventory data from a server using `fetch()` and `async/await`.
  - Synchronize inventory updates with the server.
- **Dynamic Rendering**:
  - Display product inventory dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Sorting**:
  - Sort products by name or stock levels.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handle API errors gracefully with `try...catch`.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the application interface.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality.
  - **Proxy**: Validate stock updates securely.
  - **IndexedDB**: Provide offline storage capabilities.
  - **Fetch API**: Retrieve and update inventory data.
  - **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error management using `try...catch`.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern UI design.

## Key Concepts

1. **Proxy**:
   - Used to validate product stock updates, ensuring no invalid operations are performed.

2. **IndexedDB**:
   - Provides offline storage for inventory data, ensuring functionality even without a server connection.

3. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Fetch and synchronize inventory data with a server using `fetch()` and `async/await`.

4. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Automatically update the inventory list in real-time as changes occur.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Manage API failures and unexpected operations gracefully.

## Future Enhancements

- **Sorting and Filtering**:
  - Add filters for product categories or price ranges.
  - Enable sorting by stock levels or alphabetical order.
- **User Roles**:
  - Implement roles for managing access to inventory operations.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Synchronize inventory changes in real-time for multiple users.
- **Advanced Offline Mode**:
  - Synchronize offline changes with the server upon reconnection.
